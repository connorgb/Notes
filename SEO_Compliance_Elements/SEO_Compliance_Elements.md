* Only google really is a supplier

* ### Search engines:
  * Spiders, or crawlers, gather all the data
  * Indexing the data, making it accessible
  * So algorithms can reference it

* Content, popularity, and architecture. Also bounce rate.

* How many pages on a site have a particular phrase in the `<title>` tag:
`site:www.foo.com intitle:keyword phrase`

* Google operators can’t be used together

## Keyword research

* Site theme
* Keywords:
  * Natural language: what would I search for?
  * How do people talk about my service?
  * Keyword trees
  * Niche keywords
* Keyword phrase in `<title>` or `<heading>` tag
  * Stop words: “the”, “a”, “to”, “if”, “who”
  * 3, 4, 5 word phrases
* Reinforcing and diluting
  * Just black marbles will make you the best in just black marbles, but adding other color marbles will keep ‘marbles’ tag value and lessen ‘black marbles’
* Keyword based versus semantic ‘entities’
  * Well written: expertise, authority, trust
* PPC campaign
  * Two versions of an ad, same ad for two keywords
  * Brand in (front of) `<title>`
* Siloing
  * Different landing pages for diff topics
  * Virtual siloing via link structures
  * Different but well organised content
* Keyword frequency
  * Keywords are words used twice
  * In 750 words: once in title, once or twice in description and keywords meta tags, once in first sentence of on page text, twice in first 200 words, once each in pars 2, 3, and 4, once in last part
