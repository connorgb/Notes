# The Educated Imagination by Northrop Frye

## The Motive for Metaphor
* How does english as a spoken thing relate to the study of literature?
* What is the social value of the study of literature, and “what is the place of the imagination that literature addresses itself to?” how might he define this place of the imagination?
* Describing the encounter with nature - The first impression of the unfeeling, inhuman nature of it, your inability to find yourself in if; and also your split nature of intellectual curiosity, and of an emotional reaction 
* We tend to assume the emotional side is what produces art, but the notions and the difference between ‘i like this’ and ‘i don't like this’ complicates this view. On what basis can we make this division? The example of the weed in the garden: this is predicated on firstly a division between nature at large and nature in ‘our home’ that we accept as part of ourselves - the garden, which is based on our understanding of what plants we do and do not want as part of our garden. You might want to say that this division is entirely emotional, at least for you if not for me or others, but there has to be some element of inquiry that would produce this. And this whole project of gardening is also predicated on a goal that motivates the bridging between yourself and nature to begin with.
* The important categories become not subject and object, but what you have to do and what you want to do.
* “The form of human nature, or the human form of nature” is how we might define society; the shaping of the world in our will. This involves the idea of want again. While many animals make the world in their will, we can conceptualise. This feels like a fruitless and facile distinction.
* This gives us three modes of talking about the world: consciousness, conversation, monologue, self-expression; social participation, teaching, practical knowledge, technology; and imagination, poetry. 
* Science begins with the world as it is and moves toward abstraction, mathematization, interpreting the world. Art begins with the world as we construct, our imagination as a product of this societal abstraction, and moves towards sensibility. Science moves from the sensible into the imaginary, and art from the imaginary to the sensible.
* Both these practices operate on hunch and common sense.
* Science progresses but art does not -- many artists had views we might disagree with or would be impractical. Is poetry therefore obsolete? P. 10
* Thomas love peacock -4 ages of poem 
* Shelley’s defense of poetry
* An artist's person isn't relevant to their art, though there definitely is an artistic neurotic type
* “The limit of imagination is totally human world” recapturing the lost sense of self with our surroundings
* Religions show paradise separated from the mystery of ordinary life (?) p. 13
* This indicates “in the human world the imagination has no limits” -- the plane is tyranny against time and space
* Poets use metaphor because it represents the world completely absorbed by the human mind 

## The Singing School
* The shipwrecked cannot make literature unless fully primitive, only language of necessity -- primitive lit isn't separate from other aspects of life -- through iteration a meta form of lit develops, artists play with form: early poets sexualfristration, later poets sexual release -- technique
* Literature only derives its forms from itself -- canadian literature can only be byron or dh lawrence *it's not because there’s nothing new, it’s that everything's the same* p. 23
* Giants in Time
* What kind of reality does literature have? p. 33
* “Nobody ever fought with a river god”
* Poets describe a universal event
* Realism lends itself to irony through over clarity
* Achilles is larger than life, but because he’s against something he doesn't really understand there’s an amount of irony
* Because myths are more abstract we identify with them more p. 36
* Poet means liar in some languages
* Realistic writers tend to become ironic, which involves putting the reader in a position of superiority to the subject through clarity -- achilles is larger than life
* The term symbol comes from this use of poetic metaphor -- the correspondence of natural and human p. 37
* Also “verbal structures of practical sense”-- science, religion, morality, philosophy are ways of describing the correspondence
* Allegory is literature deliberately displaying this 
* Most writers nowadays like to avoid direct allegory since it tends to rely on assumed truths 
* Literary images also reference other lit
* Yeats: doomed by odysseus and the labouring ships, and proud as priam murdered with his peers
* Lit is a complete world of which every poem is a part (yawn)
* If we don’t know the bible and other cultural lit, we can know other lits, but we cant grow
* Ionesco’s absurd la chauve cantatrice 
* Wordsworth’s daffodils move from his mind to a general mind through poetry - this poem is good because it tells you what the poet thinks he was trying to do
* There's no such thing as self expression in literature -- its only for incidental interest that we relate to a poets writing on their life
* The poet relates nature to human life -- this is why poetry specifically shows the analogy to the primitive mind
* A belief is concerned with existence or inexistence, literature is comfortable with hypotheticals -- meaning all arguments are equally good
* Therefore the purpose of literature is encouraging tolerance
* Dilletants, seized by possibility while lacking conviction, are much less common and dangerous then zealous bigots who can't perceive possibility
* Lit gives us the detachment to see experience clearly
* Literature does not reflect life but it does not escape or withdraw from it either, it swallows it p. 48

## The Keys To Dreamland
* Previously we’d dealt with primitive imagination, the most direct and simple way
* Highly artificial city is normal to us - we are motivated to conform - beauty is what we are accustomed to
* We notice lit conventions bc we’re not so used to them - fantastic situations and contrivances are the norm in lit
* “However useful literature may be in improving one's imagination or vocabulary, it would be the wildest kind of pedantry to use it directly as a guide to life” p. 52
* Byron wore himself out at thirty four from the strain of being byronic
* To bring anything to life in lit we cant be lifelike, we must be lit-like
* No one really speaks like prose, either
* Everyone said what to emily dickinson
* What's important in lit is not what the poet meant to say, but what the words actually say -  close reading dh lawrence don't trust the novelist trust the story
* Conventions impose stability even if they are unconventional
* Because books are structured and defined by allusion they cannot be attributed to individual motive (is this true?)
* Lit cant have moral value because that depends entirely on the reader - no consistent connection good or bad to everyday life(idk again)
* Lit does not need to demonstrate practicability to be valuable - lit is related to other lit, not reality
* Whatever valeu there is to reading comes from the body of lit p. 56
* Unreal in its vividness
* What is real by definition exceeds us
* Lit shows us bad images not to please us, or to disgust us, but to grant us the moral exhilaration of standing apart from them - the more exposed we are to this, the less likely we are to find an unthinking pleasure in cruel or evil things p. 60
* Lit expresses the sublime, the imagination prevents us from being destroyed as we would otherwise be by encountering these things
* Pre critical and critical response to art - critical refined sensibilities

## Verticals Of Adam
* Building a theory of literature, now we apply it
* General principle: lit follows myth-- myth is a “primitive effort of the imagination to identify the human with the nonhuman world”
* Myth becomes a structural principle of storytelling in lit
* The Bible should be the basis of lit training --- “its imaginative survey of the human situation... everything finds its place inside it”
* “Classical myths give us, much more clearly than the bible, the main episodes of the central myth of the hero” follow the seasons in their rhythm--  hercules, theseus, perseus, medusa
* Modern readers of paradise lost cannot relate because of the deficiency in the early stages of lit teaching
* Dylan thomas altarwise by owl light 
* Next step is structure of lit forms -- tragedy/comedy, romance/irony
* All irony stresses the complexity of human life in opposition to this simple world
* Romance and comedy are primary, tragedy and irony are more complex
* Romance comes out of the hero’s adventures, comedy out of “triumph or marriage”
* He takes a paragraph to say that we must suspend judgement
* Read other languages and study other arts
* We can't think properly unless we know “how much of what we think we're thinking is really thought,” and not routine mental patterns -- the “bumble has to fit into a different set of grammatical grooves.”
* Poetry is the most direct and simple means of expressing oneself in words -- only quite well developed civilisations can produce good prose - poetry teaches rhythm
* Pelham edgar ”if the rhythm of a sentence is right, the sense could look after itself”
* Image and diction of poetry; concrete and simple words
* Great lit brings into focus the cultural history of the nation that produced it
* “The shadow of an even greater victorian lady appears behind [the king and I]”
* “Everything that happens in time vanishes in time: it’s only the imagination that… can see men as “giants in time””
* Lit is to history, law, social sciences etc as math is to physics
* “Religious history is so full of metaphors of ascent” and traditional associations with the sky that “Mr Kruschev still thinks he’s made quite a point when he tells us his astronauts can’t find any trace of god in outer space” p. 78
* Being realistic instead of religious means getting ‘down’, but the subconscious is only thought of as ‘below’ because of the ‘spatial metaphor’ that describes it
* The role of criticism has grown because the number of people being culturally educated has increased -- “the fable says the tortoise won in the end, which is consoling, but the hare shows a good deal of speed and few signs of tiring”
* The third talk distinguished the world of action and belief from the world of imagination, which “expands the horizon of belief and makes it more tolerant and efficient”
* Lit teaching is “the transfer of imaginative energy from the lit to the student”

## The Vocation of Eloquence
* The 3 kinds of language, lit, ordinary speech, and information - overlap
* Lit is the language of imagination  - our social life, everything we do relies on imagination 
* Society is all about saying the right thing at the right time -- true statements still omit info
* Rhetorical situations are everywhere and only our imaginations get us out of them
* Advertisers value the central place of the imagination in social life - “what they call projecting the image” p. 84
* Our reaction to advertising is a form of criticism -- we must develop our own vision of society
* We know politicians prey on emotions - hitler
* The job of the imagination in everyday life is to produce the society we want out of the society we have -- “obviously that can’t be a separated society, so we have to understand how to relate the two.”
* Our society “presents our imagination with its own substitute for literature”
* This ‘social mythology’ persuades us to adjust to its values 
* This mythology is a necessary part of its cultures coherence
* Society changes rapidly because a large element of illusion in social mytho “is a simple matter of self protection” -- our imaginations protect us from the illusions produced by social imagination
* The social imagination creates the imaginary, diff from imaginative
* Our social mythology: advertising’s appeal to ‘status symbols’ and fear of isolation and use of cliches, jargon from institutions doublespeak, ‘good old days’ pastoralism modernity also progress myths whig history, left right dichotomy: “the person its most useful to is the person who wants to turn abusive”
* “People who accept their social mythology” can only use cliches in the face of threats - like barking its automatic
* We are expected to neither believe nor reject everything, but choose “in accordance with our own vision of society”. This power is curtailed in wartime -- orwell -- “the fear of being reduced to such a life is a genuine fear, but of course as soon as we express it in hysterical cliches we are in the same state ourselves”
* Free speech - “the speech of a free society” separates us from the mob
* Freedom can only be the product of training -- you can really cultivate speech unless you have something to cay, and that is the product of you vision of society
* The free society’s standards don’t come from the society itself
* If a smart man renounces the life of material vanity and status and wants more, he will want an education for imagination because he will have seen the modern cultural values and fits with them, and now wants to do more than be a parasite on them -- all professions recognise the ideal existence of a world beyond your interests
* People who dont know of any other world can never understand what makes it change
* If canada in 1962 is diff from canada in 1942, “it can't be a real society, but only a temporary appearance of real society” -- our ideal imaginary world has no reality except what we put into it, but is the real form of human society, “the world of what humanity has done, and therefore can do” p. 96
* Matthew Arnold - culture is ideal as opposed to social which is actual
* Saying the right thing at the right time is essential, and creates social mythology
* Tower of babel seems good and multicultural but is a “deadlock of human rivalries” “it has no genuine human dignity”
* The common language is human lit, and “speaks only in a voice too quiet for panic to hear” telling us it is time to return to the earth
