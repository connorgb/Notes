# Learn You A Flutter

## Projects

### Create Subfolders
* assets\image
  * Holds subfolders such as images, fonts, and config files
* lib\pages
  * UI files: logins, lists of items, charts, and settings
* lib\models
  * Classes for data like customer info, inventory
* lib\utils
  * Helper classes such as date calculations and conversions
* lib\widgets
  * Dart files separating widgets to reuse throughout the app
* lib\services
  * Classes to retrieve data from internet services (Firestore, cloud)

### Structuring Widgets
* The SDK does not automatically create the separate home file, which contains the main presentation page. You must make your own home.dart file in a pages folder. The main.dart file starts the app and calls the `Home` widget in the home file.
